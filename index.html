        <div class="subheading mb-5">Audio Engineer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have 5+ years experience with audio equipment. I am currently a student at University of California, Riverside as a Theatre, Film, and Digital Production Major. I grew up with a musically and technologically intelligent father. He taught me how to play different instruments and how to work with multiple technology devices.<br><br>

        I also have experience at Fat Tomato Pizza, a Pizzeria at Harbor City. As a Cash register, I serve around 30 customers every shift. I greet customers and take their orders at the register. I also communicate with the kitchen staff regularly to ensure a quick service. I was also part of a dog fostering program from Korea, I help dogs in shelters and rescues find loving homes and get adopted by fitting families. I help transport dogs by plane from Korea to the US. I also provide them a foster home and care until they get adopted. We actively look for a loving family who are willing to adopt these dogs and provide a better life for them. As a member of the Service League, we decorated, set up, cleaned up, and helped out during school events. We worked together as a team to decorate the whole Torrance High School campus. We divided into groups: cutting paper, drawing/coloring, and taping the decorations on the wall. I was on the team to tape the decorations on the walls of our campus. This was important because we were decorating the whole school for every event we held, such as homecoming and the spring dance. We also helped out the ASB members to clean up after other events, such as the canned food drive. Our SAVE Club helps clean up the environment and school campus. We promote having a clean environment and our club members regularly participate in beach and campus cleanups. We come together as a club to collaborate and save the planet and campus as students also learn the significance of cleaning up and the state of the environment in which we now live. As part of the board members of this club, I attended every event and even helped organize the events for the other members of the group. I was the connection for this club and ASB so that they had regular updates on the club activities and services. Our Korean Culture Club inspires people to learn more about Korean culture and perform traditional and modern cultural dances during the annual Korean Culture Night event (which is a night where students from the Torrance Unified School district come together to perform about the Korean culture such as KPOP dances, cultural dances, singing Korean songs, etc) and the annual Hands Across Campus (which is an event held at Torrance High School to honor and appreciate each and every culture at Torrance High School, where they even perform different songs and dances of each culture). I helped organize and prepare for the event and helped some groups to practice.<br><br>
